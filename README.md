# Radix-Conversions

This repository contains 

1) Non relative base conversions :
  a) Radix 10 to radix r
  b) Radix r to 10
  c) Radix r1 to r2

2) Relative Base Conversions

  a) Relative direct conversion
  Let ()x=()y
  then either 
    i.)  x=y^i when x>y
    ii.) y=x^i when x<y
    
    where i is a positive integer.
    
    
  b) Relative indirect conversion
  Let ()x=()y
  There is no direct relationship between x and y.
  Although, x and y are relatied to each other via radix z.
  ()x=()z=()y
  x=z^i and y=z^j
    where i and j are positive integers
  
  
  Note-> All the conversions are without considering "radix point"
